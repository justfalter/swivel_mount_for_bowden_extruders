This mount allows you to securely mount your bowden extruder while allowing it to freely swivel along the same axis that it is stepping. By allowing for this freedom of motion, the length of tubing may be greatly reduced between the extruder and hot-end. For bowden setups, less tubing means less "slop" in the line. I have no idea if allowing the extruder to swivel makes for more slop, but I figure that so long as the tubing is in place, maybe it's OK? I don't know if this will actually make your prints any better, but I'm pretty sure it has helped out on my DaVinci 1.0.

I had previously used [gobygoby](http://www.thingiverse.com/gobygoby/about)'s [Swivel Bowden Fixture](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:778685), but found that the mount did not have a firm grip on the stepper. Using a friction-fit for both the bearing and the stepper allows for a lot of rocking back and forth when extruding/retracting. Feeling that there was room for improvement, I decided to design my own.


This thing can be customized for mounting to NEMA 14, 17 (the default), or 23 steppers. The height can also be varied, if you like. 

For my DaVinci 1.0, I used a NEMA 17 mount with a 30mm total height.
